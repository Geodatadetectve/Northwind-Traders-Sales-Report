Data transformation, Data aggregation, Desktop design, DAX, Data visualization, and Data insights

Process
I examined the data thoroughly to identify any problematic data points, missing information, or duplicated entries. This careful analysis was essential for conducting precise analyses, visualizing the data effectively, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Subsequently, I used basic DAX functions to calculate various metrics, including the number of shipping days, total sales, identification of timely and delayed shipments, and the rate of sales growth over time. Finally, I segregated the cleaned data and derived significant insights to construct a high-level KPI dashboard for Northwind Traders. This dashboard primarily focused on Sales Performance, Bestselling Products, Order Processing Time, Employee Performance, and Outlet Performance. The combination of these insights and KPIs offered a comprehensive overview of Northwind Traders' performance in crucial areas such as sales, customers, products, order fulfillment, and employee performance.

Tools: Excel, Power Query, DAX, Microsoft PowerBI
